# github-battle
This is a project completed from Tyler MCginnis' [learning website](https://ui.dev/c). It's a single page application built with React that allows a user to view all the most popular repositories on github. The user is also able to switch between languages and their most popular. The user will also be able to enter in two different github usernames and 'battle' them to determine a winner based on followers and stars.

## Setup
